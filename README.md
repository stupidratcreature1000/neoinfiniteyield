# Neo Infinite Yield

The best command line script for roblox.

This is a clone of infinite yield except I add more stupid but fun commands, and maybe something useful along the way

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stupidratcreature1000/neoinfiniteyield/refs/heads/master/source"))()
```

 - Currently 401 commands
 - Open Source
 - 7+ years of development
